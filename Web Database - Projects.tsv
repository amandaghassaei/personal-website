gimbal	compass	in progress	work in progress	3d printed gimbal mechanism based on a differential gear system.	3d printed gimbal mechanism based on an interlocking differential gear system, designed in Inventor.  I'll post more about this project when it's done, for now I'll talk a little bit about my main design considerations:<br/>The inner disc should rotate on all three axes continuously without ever having to reset itself.  It needs to be able to move itself to any arbitrary position in 3D space.<br/>I wanted to hide the fact that this a digital device by keeping all the electronics and digital hardware out of sight. All of the motors involved should be stationary relative to the project enclosure - this also bypasses the problem of having to supply power to something that is rotating.<br/><br/>The movement for this project is somewhat complex, and the constraint that none of the motors should be visible was tricky to satisfy.  At the core of my design is something called a differential gear.  I'm using two layers of differential gears to get three axes of rotational motion.  This mechanism is broadly classified as a type of gimbal.	images/compass/main.jpg	images/compass/coverImage	FALSE	TRUE
genetic images	genetic_images	in progress	reconstructing images by genetic algorithm	An exploration into genetic programming beginning with a simple problem: how to best reconstruct an image using a collection of translucent polygons.	In this project, I wanted to explore some genetic systems where a solution's fitness can be easily assesed by sight,      to get a better understanding of how various parameters in a genetic program affect the output.  I'm experimenting with genetic and hill climbing algorithms,      and looking at how mutation rate, population size, method of crossover, and other parameters impact the ability of a program      to converge on a good, global solution.<br>     <br>     This work will be up on Instructables shortly, until then, my most recent code is up on <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/Genetic-Images" target="_blank">Github</a>.	images/genetic_images/main.gif		FALSE	TRUE
sugarcube	sugarcube	2014	a multi-functional, standalone MIDI instrument	A standalone, grid-based MIDI controller powered by Arduino. This project is open source and supported by an Arduino library.	The Sugarcube is an extension of the work I've been doing on the <a href="../monome">monome project</a>.     It's an open source, grid-based, standalone MIDI instrument that can be booted up into various musical applications.     It communicates via a MIDI output with other electronic MIDI instruments and software environments like Ableton and MaxMSP.     An Arduino Uno generates all of its MIDI data and drives LEDS, buttons, a 2 axis gyroscope, a 3 axis accelerometer,     and two potentiometers, and the whole device is powered by a lithium-polymer battery.	images/sugarcube/main.jpg	images/sugarcube/coverImage	FALSE	TRUE

laser cut record	laser_cut_record	2013	on acrylic, wood, paper	A program that converts digital audio files into record cutting paths. Includes demos of some of the records I've cut on a laser cutter.	As a follow up to my <a href="../3D_printed_record">3D printed records</a>, I developed a more accessible way of fabricating records with a laser cutter.  These records were cut on an Epilog 120 Watt Legend EXT to a theoretical precision of 1200dpi (though the kerf of the cut and some tricks I used to avoid crashing the laser cutter dropped the actual precision down by ~1/6).  The audio on the records has a bit depth between 4-5 bit and a sampling rate up to about 4.5kHz.  So far I've successfully cut audio on wood, acrylic, and paper, and I'm sure there are many more materials that would work.  I wrote the Processing sketch that generates the record cutting paths so that it can be modified for any song, material, cutting machine, record size, and turntable speed, find that code and more detailed info about the project on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Record/" target="_blank">Instructables</a>.

3D printed record	3D_printed_record	2012	converting digital audio into a physical, functional LP	A program that converts digital audio files into 3D printable records. Includes demos of some of the records I've printed.	In order to explore the current limits of 3D printing, I've created a technique for converting digital     audio files into 3D-printable, 33rpm records that play on ordinary turntables.  Though     the audio quality is low, the audio output is still easily recognizable - the records have a sampling rate of 11kHz and 5-6 bit     resolution.     These records were printed on an Objet Connex500 resin printer to a precision of 600dpi with 16 micron z axis     resolution.  The 3D modeling in this project was far too complex to do by hand, so     I wrote a program to do this conversion automatically.  It works by importing raw audio data, performing some     calculations to generate the geometry of a 12" record, and eventually exporting this geometry straight to a 3D     printable file format.  Most of the heavy lifting is done by     <a href="http://www.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, here's a basic overview of my Processing     code:<br/><br/> <b>use raw audio data to set the groove depth</b> - parse through the raw audio data (this is the set of numbers that     defines the shape of the audio waveform) and use this information to set the height of the bottom of a spiral groove.     This way, when a turntable stylus moves along the groove it will move vertically in the same path as the original     waveform and recreate the original audio signal.<br/> <b>draw record and groove geometry</b> - A 3D model is essentially a list of triangles arranged in 3D space to create a     continuous mesh, use the data from the last step and some general record parameters (record diameter, thickness,     groove width, etc) to generate the list of triangular faces that describes the record's shape and the detailed     spiral groove inscribed on its surface.<br/> <b>export model in STL format</b> - the STL file format is a 3D format understood by most 3D printers.  To get Processing     to export straight to STL, I used the     <a href ="http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/2011/04/06/code-modelbuilder-library-public-release/" target="_blank">ModelBuilder Library</a> written by <a href="http://mariuswatz.com/" target="_blank">Marius Watz</a>.<br/><br/> The video below shows the entire record-making process and features some of the audio I've been able to reproduce, more     audio can be found in the following video.

glitchbox	glitchbox	2012	a sample-based drum machine, looper, and MIDI sequencer	A sample-based drum machine, looper, and MIDI sequencer.	An experiment pushing the limits of the Arduino's memory.  The glitchbox is an Arduino powered, sample-based drum machine used for live audio or MIDI sequencing.  The buttons on the front of the instrument play back nine audio samples stored in the Arduino's memory.  A switch on top records and loops sequences of these samples.  Once a sequence is recorded, additional samples may be layered and automatically looped on top.  Recorded sequences may also be temporarily muted or cleared and rerecorded, and two knobs on top of the instrument control volume and tempo.  Complete build documentation can be found on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Electronic-Instrument/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">Instructables</a>.<!--The glitchbox is an electronic instrument used for live audio sequencing.

ambient synthesis	ambient_synthesis	2012	an interactve sound sculpture	Ambient synthesis is a sound sculpture that responds to light stimuli to construct a unique, audiovisual interpretation of its environment.	Ambient synthesis is a sound sculpture that responds to light stimuli to construct a unique, audiovisual interpretation of its environment. Light sensors in the device pick up changes in its surroundings (the scenes from this video demonstrate the piece responding to sunsets and sunrises). This data is interpreted by a MaxMSP application to produce abstract symmetrical patterns and a slowly evolving synthetic drone. The inspiration for the piece comes from the idea that simple sounds can be mixed together to create more complex sounds, an idea called 'additive synthesis.' In this piece, each pixel represents one frequency of a harmonic series. When a pixel becomes active, its respective frequency is incorporated into the mix to create a gradually evolving soundscape that, over time, produces a wide range of timbres and textures.	images/ambient_synthesis/main.jpg	images/ambient_synthesis/coverImage	FALSE	TRUE

mechanical walking machine	mechanical_walking_machine	2011	a mechanical leg linkage inspired by the work of Theo Jansen	A kinetic sculpture I designed and built, inspired by the work of <a href="http://strandbeest.com" target="_blank">Theo Jansen</a>.	Inspired by the work of <a href="http://strandbeest.com" target="_blank">Theo Jansen</a>, I designed a mechanical leg     system and implemented it in a large kinetic sculpture.  I modeled and optimized the geometry of the linkage in     Mathematica to achieve a suitable combination of efficiency, stability, and step height.  The structure is made     predominantly from PVC pipe and zip ties.  The video above demonstrates the movement of the structure while flipped     on its "back" with its "feet" in the air, unfortunately I wasn't able to capture any footage of it right side up     before it destroyed itself under its own weight.  In the future, I'd like to model this in CAD software and 3D print     a small, functional version.

multitouch	multitouch	2010	development of a thin, infrared-based multitouch system	Development of a thin, infrared-based multitouch system.	I designed and built an infrared-based multitouch system.  It uses a technique called     <a href="http://sethsandler.com/multitouch/llp/" target="_blank">Laser Light Plane</a> to generate a thin plane of     IR light over the surface of glass.  When an object, like a finger, breaks this plane by touching the glass surface,     IR light is scattered down into an array of IR phototransistors under the glass surface.  An Arduino Uno scans this     array of phototransistors and determines the coordinates of the point(s) of contact.  The Arduino also controls an     array of white LEDs which can be programmed for various forms of visual feedback.  Currently, this device is connected     to a computer via USB and used as a multipurpose controller for <a href="../monome">monome     applications</a> written in <a href="../maxmsp">MaxMSP</a>.  Some of my design criteria for this     project are listed below: <br/><br/> <b>inexpensive</b>- I build this device using inexpensive and easily sourced components, the electronic components     involved include IR phototransistors, white LEDs, shift registers, small IR lasers, and an Arduino Uno. <br/><br/> <b>modular and scalable</b>- Each pixel of the device is comprised of the same modular unit (one IR phototransistor and     one white LED).  This makes the Arduino code is very simple and easily extended to fit a larger or denser array. <br/><br/> <b>thin</b>- most IR-sensing multitouch uses a camera to track the position of "blobs" (points where your fingers make     contact with the surface of the screen), but these systems require that the camera be positioned far from the screen     so that it can "see" the entire surface.  My system uses an array or IR phototransistors positioned directly under     the screen to minimize the amount of depth needed.  This prototype has a depth of about 4 inches, but the IR transistor     array could potentially be scaled to make the total depth of the device well under an inch.<br/><br/> Full documentation is up on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Multitouch-Music-Controller/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">Instructables</a>.	images/multitouch/main.jpg	images/multitouch/coverImage	FALSE	TRUE
